        <p>
          I'm a advanced systems student at the National Technological
          University in Buenos Aires, Argentina. My strong point is: Fullstack
          with MERN: Javascript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB,
          although I handle LAMP too. I usually handle HTML, CSS and CSS
          Frameworks, like Bootstrap, with GIT and API REST in my proyects. In
          terms of POO I often use Java I'm interested in everything related to
          technology, especially web apps. IÂ´m a Junior profile, therefore I
          don't have much job experience, but I'm looking for learn constantly,
          professionally grow and add value in IT companies. Thanks.
